# 📊 Parch & Posey SQL Practice

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written as part of my practice using the Parch & Posey database, based on the Udacity SQL course.

## 📁 File Structure

- `parch_posey_sql_practice.sql`: A SQL file with queries organized by topic, including:
  - Basic `SELECT` queries
  - Filtering with `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and `LIMIT`
  - Joins between multiple tables
  - Aggregation with `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
  - Multi-table relationships based on foreign keys

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- SQL Basics (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)
- Filtering with operators (`LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `AND`, `OR`)
- SQL Joins (`INNER JOIN`, relationships across tables)
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`)
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`
- Understanding ERDs (Entity-Relationship Diagrams)

## 📚 About the Data

The dataset models a fictional business, Parch & Posey, and includes the following tables:

- `accounts`: Clients and their contact details
- `orders`: Sales orders, quantities, and prices
- `sales_reps`: Sales representatives and their regions
- `region`: Regional data for sales reps
- `web_events`: Website traffic by account

## 🛠️ Tools

- PostgreSQL (syntax used)
- VS Code / SQL editors
- Git & GitHub for version control
